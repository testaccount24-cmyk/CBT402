INTRODUCTION :

THE REXX PROGRAM SMFP0001 READS SMCA BLOCK AND PRINTS THE SMF STATUS.

THS UTILITY WILL BE HELPFUL FOR THE OPERATORS WHO HAVE TO MONITOR
THE SMF STATUS OF MANY SYSTEMS IN A DATA CENTER.

THIS UTILITY DOES NOT REQUIRE ANY AUTOMATION TOOL TO ISSUE 'D SMF'
AND TRAP THE RESPONSE.  THE PROGRAM IS EXECUTED THRU A JCL SMFJ0001.
THIS JCL CAN BE SUITABLY MODIFIED TO EXCUTE ON VARIOUS SYSTEMS AND
BRING IN THE DATA TO ONE SINGLE SYSTEMS TO KNOW THE SMF STATUS.
